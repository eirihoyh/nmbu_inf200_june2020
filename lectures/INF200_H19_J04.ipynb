    "\n",
    "- Test methods that depend on random numbers\n",
    "- Exact results will depend on precise sequence of random numbers generated, i.e., on the random generator used and the random seed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fixed seed\n",
    "By seeding the random number generator with a fixed value, we can ensure that we always get the same sequence of random numbers; particularly important while debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires that we know which random number generator is used by methods tested\n",
    "- Adding more tests or changing tests or code can change the way in which random numbers are consumed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mocking\n",
    "Mock the random number function to return a fixed value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows us to check that the code using the random numbers works as expected\n",
    "- Does not test whether the result has the expected distribution\n",
    "- Requires that we know exactly how the code draws random numbers (white box testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- The principal approach is based on statistical testing of hypothesis\n",
    "    - Formulate a hypothesis (expectation), e.g., \"value $x$ is a sample of random variable $X$ which has a normal (Gaussian) distribution of given mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma$\"\n",
    "    - Find the $p$-value of $x$, i.e., the probability to observe a value at least as far from the mean as $x$ if $x$ indeed follows the assumed distribution\n",
    "    - Compare the $p$-value to a predefined acceptance limit $\\alpha$: if $p>\\alpha$ the test is passed\n",
    "- Interpretation: Let, e.g., $\\alpha=0.01=1\\%$. If we observe a value $x$ with a $p$-value less than $\\alpha=1\\%$, this means that the value $x$ belongs to the outer tail of the assumed distribution, among those values that make up the 1% least likely values in the distribution. We thus assume that $x$ did not come from the expected distribution and declare the test failed.\n",
    "- Note: By construction, this test will fail in 1% of all cases even if $x$ follows the assumed distribution. Thus, failures need to be inspected carefully.\n",
    "- See, e.g., Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, vol 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of statistical tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- [$Z$-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-test)\n",
    "    - Strictly speaking, tests whether the mean of $n$ random values drawn independently from the same distribution is from a Gaussian distribution of given mean and variance \n",
    "    - Due to the [central limit theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem), it can also be applied in many other cases as an approximation provided we are considering averages of many trials\n",
    "    - If the variance of the Gaussian distribution is not know a priori, one should use [Student's $t$-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) instead\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Binomial test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_test)\n",
    "    - An explicit test for binomially distributed quantities, e.g., the number of successes in $n$ Bernoulli experiments (coin flips)\n",
    "    - See also [GraphPad](http://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/8/statistics/index.htm?stat_binomial.htm) for an explanation of the test. The [binomial test in SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binom.html) uses the same approach as GraphPad\n",
